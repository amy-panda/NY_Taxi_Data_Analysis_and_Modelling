# New York Taxi Trips - Data Analysis and Predictive Modelling
This project focuses on the taxi trips in New York City from 2019 to 2022 and performs data processing, transformation as well as analysis with Databricks Spark to provide business findings and insights. Two algorithms - Multiple Linear Regression and Decision Tree are used to build regression models, aimed at predicting the total fare amount of taxi trips based on the features like trip duration, taxi speed, tips and so on.
